# Project Overview

This project is a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed for learning and practicing fundamental Python programming concepts. The files cover topics such as variables (strings, lists, dictionaries), conditional statements (`if`), and loops (`while`).

## Directory Overview

The `codes` directory contains the following files:

*   `01_variables_string.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of string variables.
*   `02_variables_list.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of lists.
*   `03_variables_dict.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of dictionaries.
*   `04_variables_bundles.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of tuples and other data structures.
*   `05_ifs.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of `if` statements.
*   `06_whiles.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of `while` loops.

## Usage

These files are intended to be used for self-study and practice. The `.ipynb` files can be opened and run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The `.py` files can be run from the command line using the Python interpreter.

### Running Python Scripts

To run the Python scripts, use the following command:

```bash
python codes/<filename>.py
```

For example, to run `05_ifs.py`:

```bash
python codes/05_ifs.py
```

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. Once installed, you can run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to the `codes` directory and open the `.ipynb` files.
